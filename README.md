## Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently focused on developing practical skills in data analysis using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **PostgreSQL**.

In Excel, I frequently use **Pivot Tables**, **VLOOKUP**, **Power Query**, and data cleaning techniques to extract insights from raw datasets.  
I'm also gaining hands-on experience with **relational databases**, writing queries for real-world scenarios.

Although I'm based in TÃ¼rkiye, I'm open to global remote work opportunities and collaboration on international projects.
