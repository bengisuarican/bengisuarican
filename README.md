## Welcome to my GitHub profile ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently focused on developing practical skills in data analysis using **Excel**, **SQL**, and **PostgreSQL**.

In **Excel**, I work extensively with Pivot Tables, lookup and text functions, conditional formatting, Power Query, and various data cleaning techniques to transform and analyze datasets.

In **SQL**, I use aggregation functions, conditional logic, subqueries, CTEs, and window functions to answer business questions using real-world datasets.

Although I'm based in TÃ¼rkiye, I'm open to **global remote work opportunities** and collaboration on international projects.

ðŸ“Š **Latest Project:** [SQL Coding Exercises â€“ Udemy Course]([https://github.com/bengisuarican/SQL-Coding-Exercises])  
ðŸ“ˆ **Next Project (coming soon):** Excel Dashboard with Advanced Functions
